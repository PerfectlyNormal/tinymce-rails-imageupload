# tinymce-rails-imageupload

  Simple plugin for TinyMCE that allows uploading images and inserting.
  It makes no assumptions about how you store the images, but it POSTs to a URL and expects JSON back (see the Setup section).

  This plugin borrows heavily from work done by [Peter Shoukry](http://77effects.com/).

  The icon used for the button comes from the icon set [Silk by famfamfam](http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/)

## Requirements

  * Rails >= 3.1
  * TinyMCE using the advanced theme and jQuery

## Setup

### Add the gem to your Gemfile

  gem 'tinymce-rails-imageupload', '~> 3.5.6.2'

### Set up TinyMCE as you would normally, but in the call to `.tinymce()`, add

  plugins: "uploadimage"
  # theme_advanced_buttonsX must include "uploadimage" somewhere to have the button appear

  and the rest should happen automatically.

### Set up upload URL and handler

  The plugin defaults to POSTing to '/tinymce\_assets".  You may modify it by supplying option "uploadimage\_form\_url" in the call to `.tinymce()`

  Routing to your controller must be done manually.  Set it up using something similar in `routes.rb`:

    post '/tinymce_assets' => 'tinymce_assets#create'

  The plugin will relay option "uploadimage\_hint" in the call to `.tinymce()` to the POSTed URL as param `hint`.  You may use this to relay any hints you wish (for example, blog post ID #) to the controller.

  This action gets called with a file parameter creatively called `file`, and must respond with JSON, containing the URL to the image.

  The JSON has to be returned with a content type of "text/html" to work, which is going to be fixed as soon as possible ([issue #7](https://github.com/PerfectlyNormal/tinymce-rails-imageupload/issues/7)).

  Example:

    class TinymceAssetsController < ApplicationController
      def create
        # Take upload from params[:file] and store it somehow...
        # Optionally also accept params[:hint] and consume if needed

        render json: {
          image: {
            url: view_context.image_url(image)
          }
        }, content_type: "text/html"
      end
    end

  If the JSON response contains a `width` and/or `height` key, those will be used in the inserted HTML (`<img src="..." width="..." height="...">`), but if those are not present, the inserted HTML is just `<img src="...">`.

## Internationalization

I18n is taken care of by `tinymce-rails`. This gem includes strings for english, norwegian, russian and portugese. 
To add your own language, create the files `<code>.js` and `<code>_dlg.js` in `vendor/assets/javascripts/tinymce/plugins/uploadimage/langs` in your application,
or fork the gem and add your own translations there.

The available strings are listed below:

### en.js

    tinyMCE.addI18n('en.uploadimage', {
      desc: 'Insert an image from your computer'
    });

### en_dlg.js

    tinyMCE.addI18n('en.uploadimage_dlg', {
      title: 'Insert image',
      header: "Insert image",
      input:  "Choose an image",
      insert: "Insert",
      cancel: "Cancel"
    });

## Versioning

The version of this gem will be mirroring the release of `tinymce-rails` it is tested against.

## Licensing

The plugin is released under the MIT license.
